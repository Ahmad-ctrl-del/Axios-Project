# âš¡ Axios Project

A hands-on project built with **React** to practice real-world data fetching and manipulation using **Axios**.  
It simulates a real-world store by consuming the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/), performing full **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and handling asynchronous data with **Promises** and **async/await**.  
This project demonstrates one of the most in-demand skills for modern frontend development: **API integration and stateful data handling**.
